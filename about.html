         <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>My name is Almira and from the Northeastern region of America. I’m fluent in English (and speak a bit of Spanish, French, and Italian). Moreover, I’m a diligent computer programmer, STEM researcher/writer, AI enthusiast, tea addict, and a cat mom.</p>
            
          <p>Computer technology is something I have been passionate about for as long as I can remember. I thoroughly enjoy developing software as a means to express ingenuity and acquire new skill sets and techniques. Within the past few years, I familiarized myself with several programming languages (JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Python, SQL, and some Java), mainly for web, app, and machine learning developments.
          </p>

          <p>Currently, I am an associate student at college. With my passion for computer science and software engineering, I am seeking a global perspective in IT while taking courses in Sociology and Business.</p>

          <p>I am pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science degree in software development to build social justice resources. My interests in the study of society, human behavior and relationships, and anthropology has driven me to work towards a sociology minor to compliment my computer science studies.</p>

          <p>After graduation, I plan on connecting my new knowledge in IT and sociology to better understand the culture, biology, history, and even psychology of human beings. </p>
